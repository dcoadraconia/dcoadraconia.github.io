				'Twas the day of the Solstice, and all through the snow
				<br><br>
				All the dragons were bustling, moving to and fro
				<br><br>
				This morning, as always, they worked with great care
				<br><br>
				To grow the new village, a mission they share
				<br><br>
				Now in this crowd of dragons that were walking about
				<br><br>
				In the thick of the crowd was a lovable lout
				<br><br>
				Solar, the Ghost Seer, was hurrying along
				<br><br>
				He was running around, as though something was wrong.
				<br><br>
				The others did watch as he ran through the town
				<br><br>
				What was he up to? Would he ever slow down?
				<br><br>
				After running a while, Solar reached a small tent
				<br><br>
				He knocked at the door, some time waiting he spent
				<br><br>
				'Til at last a steel face did peek through the tarp
				<br><br>
				For this tent was the home of Solar's friend Sharp!
				<br><br>
				She looked into his eyes, and she wondered, quite curious
				<br><br>
				"What brings you here, Solar? ...Is it something serious?"
				<br><br>
				He replied "Sharp, oh goodness, I'm so glad you're here...
				<br><br>
				I completely forgot about Solstice this year!"
				<br><br>
				"Oh, yes, Solar, you're right! An intriguing event!"
				<br><br>
				And before he could reply, to her back room Sharp went
				<br><br>
				She returned a bit later with notebook and pen
				<br><br>
				"The Solstice is fascinating! Where to even begin?
				<br><br>
				Today is the day the world's axial tilt
				<br><br>
				Reaches the highest, up to which it has built!
				<br><br>
				Today is the day we're farthest from the sun,
				<br><br>
				So it's the shortest day! Isn't science so fun?"
				<br><br>
				Solar stood there a moment, mouth open in shock
				<br><br>
				Sharp was hurting his brain with her smart person talk!
				<br><br>
				"That's, um, that's nice Sharp, I am sure that's all true
				<br><br>
				But I came to get help! I have so much to do!"
				<br><br>
				"Oh! If you need my help, then I'll be sure to act!
				<br><br>
				What do you need help with? Is it more science facts?"
				<br><br>
				"NO!! I mean, umm, I could use your help shopping...
				<br><br>
				There's so much to consider! I have no time for stopping!"
				<br><br>
				"Shopping? Solar, why'd you need my help with THAT?
				<br><br>
				Are you not paid enough, is what you're getting at?"
				<br><br>
				"Um, no, I got all these cool strings from the Council!
				<br><br>
				They're worth what I need, so I'm not really doubtful.
				<br><br>
				It's more that I don't really know what to buy-
				<br><br>
				But you know a lot! So I thought I would try."
				<br><br>
				"Oh! Well, I guess we can go to the store...
				<br><br>
				Umm... What exactly were you in the market for?"
				<br><br>
				"Well, Sharp, it's the Solstice, so I need to get
				<br><br>
				New gifts for my friends! I'm trying not to fret
				<br><br>
				But I've so many friends now, of so many kinds
				<br><br>
				And they're all just so different! I'm falling behind!
				<br><br>
				In Home Cave it was easy to make Solstice plans
				<br><br>
				I got everyone cool rocks, or mosses, or sand
				<br><br>
				But here in the camp, there's just so much around!
				<br><br>
				And so many options! How to narrow it down?!"
				<br><br>
				"Wait, um, hold on there, Solar! I'm kinda confused.
				<br><br>
				Is there something I'm missing?" the Blade Dragon mused.
				<br><br>
				"Why're you buying gifts for everyone at once?
				<br><br>
				That sounds exhausting, if I may be blunt."
				<br><br>
				"Well yes, Sharp, it is, but it's Solstice, you see?
				<br><br>
				It's the season of gift-giving, it's how it must be!
				<br><br>
				So let's go," he said, and he started to turn-
				<br><br>
				But Sharp, on the other claw, wanted to learn.
				<br><br>
				She pulled out her pencil, she pulled out her notes
				<br><br>
				In her study on Sun Dragons, a new section she wrote.
				<br><br>
				"Oh, I get it! I realize the point of this mission!
				<br><br>
				Is gift-giving on the Solstice a Sun Dragon tradition?"
				<br><br>
				"Why, yes, of course, Sharp!" Solar said, turning back.
				<br><br>
				"I guess it's a custom that Blade Dragons lack?"
				<br><br>
				"Indeed," Sharp responded, her eyes twinkling like lights.
				<br><br>
				"Every dragon tribe has their own special rites.
				<br><br>
				The Leaf Dragons feast and they gather with cheer
				<br><br>
				When the start of the winter comes 'round every year.
				<br><br>
				The Bloom Dragons hold a dance after the first frost
				<br><br>
				Snowstorm Dragons clear a path for the ones they have lost.
				<br><br>
				Lilypads watch the moon, well into the night...
				<br><br>
				And Orca Dragons - Well, I'm not sure. They probably just fight.
				<br><br>
				Glass Dragons, each year when the winter begins...
				<br><br>
				They hold a sacred ceremony, for forgiveness of sins.
				<br><br>
				The point is that, Solar, across every tribe
				<br><br>
				Are unique winter customs to which dragons subscribe."
				<br><br>
				"Wow!" Solar replied. "That sounds really great!
				<br><br>
				I guess different traditions are a draconic trait!
				<br><br>
				And what about you? What about the Blade Dragons?
				<br><br>
				What winter festival are you gonna be having?"
				<br><br>
				"Well..." Sharp began, turning the pen in her clutch,
				<br><br>
				"Honestly, Solar, we don't really do much.
				<br><br>
				Blade Dragons don't celebrate anything specific...
				<br><br>
				We find winter festivities unscientific."
				<br><br>
				Hearing this, Solar's wings and his sun too did droop
				<br><br>
				And his whole body lowered in a sort of sad stoop.
				<br><br>
				"No parties? No Solstice? But Sharp, that's so sad!
				<br><br>
				Missing out on the festivals must feel so bad!"
				<br><br>
				"Well, a little," said Sharp, "It does kinda stink."
				<br><br>
				And as Solar heard this, he began to think.
				<br><br>
				He thought and he thought, as he let out a "Hrrrmmm..."
				<br><br>
				And he thought some more thoughts, the silly little wyrm.
				<br><br>
				Then, he got an idea! His sun lit up bright
				<br><br>
				And he knew what to do so he could make things right.
				<br><br>
				"Sharp, since you don't have a tradition of your own...
				<br><br>
				You can celebrate Solstice so you won't be alone!
				<br><br>
				You can be like a Sun Dragon, Sharp, don't you see?
				<br><br>
				And you'll get to celebrate with my friends, and with me!"
				<br><br>
				"Oh, that would be great!" Sharp replied with a shout,
				<br><br>
				"But, I don't know what Solstice is even about!"
				<br><br>
				"Well..." Solar said, as he started to smile,
				<br><br>
				"I can teach you about it, but it'll take a while."
				<br><br>
				"Really? You would?" Sharp asked, beaming with glee.
				<br><br>
				"Of course!" Solar responded. "Now, umm, let's see..."
				<br><br>
				"This is so exciting! A Sun Dragon holiday?
				<br><br>
				It sounds so fascinating! What a discovery! Yay!"
				<br><br>
				"It is! You'll love it! There's no need to worry..."
				<br><br>
				"So let me begin telling the Solstice Story."
				<br><br>
				"Long, long ago, as I have always heard..."
				<br><br>
				Solar began, as Sharp recorded each word.
				<br><br>
				"In the sky, way up high, where the Great Dragons are...
				<br><br>
				Way back then, after dark, the night sky had no stars!"
				<br><br>
				"Huh?" Sharp interrupted. "That doesn't make sense!"
				<br><br>
				"The stars were always there! They're formed out of dense-"
				<br><br>
				"Sharp, please don't interrupt in the Solstice Story...
				<br><br>
				It's very important." ... "Oh, um, my bad, hehe, sorry."
				<br><br>
				"So, as I was saying, long ago, during night...
				<br><br>
				There weren't any stars! There wasn't any light!
				<br><br>
				In the sky, in the dark, there was only the Moon."
				<br><br>
				"Umm, Solar, why not?" ... "Shhh, I'll get to that soon."
				<br><br>
				"In the sky were two Great Dragons, of the Moon and the Sun...
				<br><br>
				Each crossed the sky each day when the other was done.
				<br><br>
				The Sun was brought by the Great Sun Dragon Sol.
				<br><br>
				He was a lot like us, as I've always been told.
				<br><br>
				At night, the sky was the Great Moon Dragon's home.
				<br><br>
				Her name was Luna, and the night sky she roamed.
				<br><br>
				This continued each day, throughout all the years...
				<br><br>
				When one Great Dragon was far, the other was near.
				<br><br>
				Now Sol was very happy! He brought the Sun every day...
				<br><br>
				And in his Sun's light, all the dragons would play!
				<br><br>
				He loved watching over Earth's dragons, the big and the small
				<br><br>
				Seeing them smile was his favorite of all.
				<br><br>
				At the horizon each evening, when the two dragons met,
				<br><br>
				Sol would talk to his friend Luna during sunset.
				<br><br>
				He'd tell Luna about all the things he had seen
				<br><br>
				About the Earth's dragons living under his sun's gleam.
				<br><br>
				He'd wish her good luck on her crossing of the sky
				<br><br>
				And then he'd say farewell, and away he would fly.
				<br><br>
				Now Sol didn't know, and he never had...
				<br><br>
				But the truth was that Luna was really quite sad.
				<br><br>
				For as Sol left the sky and flew off of the edge,
				<br><br>
				All the dragons he'd watched made their way to their beds.
				<br><br>
				And as Luna crossed the sky, with no light that shone...
				<br><br>
				Earth's dragons went to sleep, leaving Luna all alone.
				<br><br>
				Luna knew all about day from what Sol had told...
				<br><br>
				But what she saw each night was only dark and cold.
				<br><br>
				As the Earth's dragons slept, it was just Luna only.
				<br><br>
				She had no one to watch over... She got very lonely.
				<br><br>
				The next morning each day, the two would met again...
				<br><br>
				Sol would ask what she'd seen, if she'd made any friends.
				<br><br>
				Luna'd say it was fine, so that he wouldn't worry...
				<br><br>
				She'd dodge all his questions, and leave in a hurry.
				<br><br>
				So Sol never realized that something was wrong...
				<br><br>
				He just thought she was tired, as her flight had been long.
				<br><br>
				Now this all continued for a very long time...
				<br><br>
				Sol not knowing the truth, Luna saying it was fine...
				<br><br>
				Until one evening, the night of Luna's hatching-day,
				<br><br>
				She could bear it no longer. There was simply no way.
				<br><br>
				Her hatching-day had the longest night of the year.
				<br><br>
				And she would be alone that whole time... It was clear.
				<br><br>
				She watched as Sol reached the edge of the sky...
				<br><br>
				This was all too much for her. Luna began to cry.
				<br><br>
				Sol saw his friend crying, as he flew along...
				<br><br>
				He landed next to Luna and asked her what was wrong.
				<br><br>
				Luna, still crying, collapsed to the ground...
				<br><br>
				She told him how each night no one was around.
				<br><br>
				She told Sol that she was so sad and alone...
				<br><br>
				And Sol was just shocked! He never had known!
				<br><br>
				Sol sat down beside her, hugging her with his wing...
				<br><br>
				And finally, Luna told Sol everything.
				<br><br>
				As Sol heard all this, he didn't know what to say!
				<br><br>
				He hugged his dear friend, said it would be okay.
				<br><br>
				Luna then told Sol that she planned to leave.
				<br><br>
				No one needed the Moon... Just the Sun, she believed.
				<br><br>
				Sol was the one who the earth's Dragons loved...
				<br><br>
				His presence they celebrated, as he flew above.
				<br><br>
				But the Moon was forever ignored, on and on...
				<br><br>
				No one would even notice if Luna was gone.
				<br><br>
				Sol told her to stay, but his words were in vain...
				<br><br>
				She could not bear the night. It brought her too much pain.
				<br><br>
				Sol looked at his friend... He looked at his Sun...
				<br><br>
				And he knew, in that moment, what had to be done.
				<br><br>
				He held out his claw, and, as Sun Dragons tell...
				<br><br>
				Sol then cast upon his Sun a powerful spell.
				<br><br>
				It shimmered with light, and from it there came
				<br><br>
				Hundreds and thousands of twinkling flames.
				<br><br>
				They rose into the sky, all of the tiny sparks
				<br><br>
				And throughout the night sky, they banished the dark.
				<br><br>
				Sol told Luna that now, she wasn't alone.
				<br><br>
				She'd now be surrounded by little suns that shone.
				<br><br>
				Luna was amazed! She stared into the sky...
				<br><br>
				Looking to the stars she'd now find her way by.
				<br><br>
				As stars filled the night sky, dragons rose from their beds...
				<br><br>
				And out of their homes, they poked their little heads.
				<br><br>
				Earth's dragons all looked to the sky in such awe...
				<br><br>
				As stars were something none of them ever saw.
				<br><br>
				His spell now complete, Sol rose and he stood...
				<br><br>
				He told Luna he hoped her hatching-day would be good.
				<br><br>
				Though Luna kept crying, a sight that Sol feared...
				<br><br>
				Luna smiled and hugged Sol... These were joyful tears!
				<br><br>
				With the sky full of lights, watched by dragons below...
				<br><br>
				This night would not be one of sadness and woe.
				<br><br>
				Luna let go of Sol, preparing to lift
				<br><br>
				And thanked him, so grateful she was for Sol's gift.
				<br><br>
				She was so very thankful, from the bottom of her heart...
				<br><br>
				But it was well past evening now, and night had to start.
				<br><br>
				She looked to the earth, wiped the tears from her eyes,
				<br><br>
				She rose into the air, and she told Sol goodbye.
				<br><br>
				Sol waved goodbye back, as the Moon now she carried,
				<br><br>
				He knew Luna's emotions would no longer be buried.
				<br><br>
				And Sol called out to Luna as she flew out of sight
				<br><br>
				Wishing her a Starry Solstice, and a wonderful night."
				<br><br>
				And with that, Solar's story of Solstice was over.
				<br><br>
				He grinned at Sharp, taking a breath to recover.
				<br><br>
				"So, Sharp, tell me what do you think of all that?
				<br><br>
				Do you understand now what I was getting at?
				<br><br>
				Solstice is a time, as I've always been taught,
				<br><br>
				To show that I care to those I love a lot."
				<br><br>
				Sharp stopped scribbling notes hearing what Solar spoke...
				<br><br>
				She looked at him, her journal letting off wisps of smoke.
				<br><br>
				"Wait, Solar, that's IT??? I made the connection,
				<br><br>
				The story was sweet, but I've so many QUESTIONS!!!!
				<br><br>
				How is it a dragon can carry the moon?
				<br><br>
				What does Luna do after dawn, in morning or noon?
				<br><br>
				Why aren't the stars visible during the day?
				<br><br>
				When Sol comes in the morning, does he take them away?
				<br><br>
				Or what about eclipses? How are moon phases done?
				<br><br>
				Can all Sun Dragons do that spell with their suns?"
				<br><br>
				"Umm, honestly Sharp, I have no idea.
				<br><br>
				You'd have to ask Ba-Bu, or Nova, or Tia."
				<br><br>
				"Oh, Solar, you silly, I'm just messing with you!
				<br><br>
				It's just a cute story, it's not even true!"
				<br><br>
				"It IS true! I bet they were both friends with Spei!
				<br><br>
				Sometime I'll ask her, and then you will see!"
				<br><br>
				"Sure, Solar," Sharp laughed, while up she was hopping.
				<br><br>
				"But first, let's go deal with all that Solstice shopping."
				<br><br>
				"OH NO!" Solar exclaimed. "You're right! We have to go!"
				<br><br>	
				And he ran out the door and dashed into the snow.
				<br><br>
				So out to the village Sharp ran with her friend...
				<br><br>
				To this Solstice dragon-tale bringing: The End.
