				<span style="font-size:22px; margin-left:-14px"><i>What is the Draconia Advent Event?</i></span><br>
				<span style="margin-left:-12px">-</span> The "Draconia Advent Event" is an unofficial collection of <i>Draconia: Curse of Anti-Magic</i> fan content created by Big-T Rex and uploaded to his Draconia fan website (where you are right now.) It is mainly composed of Draconia fanfiction and some teasers for Draconia fandom stuff Rex is still working on.
				
				
				<br><br><br>
				<span style="font-size:22px; margin-left:-14px"><i>What the heck is a Draconia?</i></span><br>
				<span style="margin-left:-12px">-</span> If you don't know what Draconia is, umm, you're in the wrong place.<br><i>Draconia: Curse of Anti-Magic</i> is a personal story project created by one person, and she's shared her stories about it with a handful of people (Big-T Rex being one of them). If you haven't heard about Draconia, you won't understand anything happening here. Sorry.
				
				<br><br><br>				
				
				<span style="font-size:22px; margin-left:-14px"><i>How do I view the Event content?</i></span><br>
				<span style="margin-left:-12px">-</span> The Event's content is spread across a number of different "secret pages" on this website. To access a "secret page," enter into your web browser the web address of this website (https://dcoadraconia.github.io) followed by a "/" and then the name of the page. For example, you could try to access the secret page "secret" by going to https://dcoadraconia.github.io/secret. If the page exists, then it will load and display to your device. Otherwise (such as in this example page, which isn't a real secret page) you will be taken to the GitHub Pages default 404 page, meaning that the page you are trying to view does not exist.
				
				<br><br><br>
				
				<span style="font-size:22px; margin-left:-14px"><i>Things to remember when finding secret pages</i></span><br>
				<span style="margin-left:-12px">-</span> Each secret page is at an address of the form</span><br><span style="color:red;">"https://dcoadraconia.github.io/&ltsecret&gt"</span><br> where "&ltsecret&gt" is replaced with the name of the page. Secret page names are one word, so no spaces (" ") or underscores ("_").<br>Furthermore, all secret page names must be typed in fully lowercase and no uppercase characters, or else GitHub Pages will not recognize the name of the page. (Use "secret", not "Secret" or "SECRET".)
				
				<br><br><br>
				
				<span style="font-size:22px; margin-left:-14px"><i>What are the names of the secret pages?</i></span><br>
				<span style="margin-left:-12px">-</span> Well, they wouldn't be a "secret" if you knew the names, would they? :P<br>You'll have to guess the names on your own. Many of them are related to Draconia, so thinking about words related to Draconia could be a good starting point.
				<br>
				<span style="margin-left:-12px">-</span> Need more hints? Well, good news! Each day after December 12, this page will be updated with a hint that will help you find one of the secret pages! The hint relates to the name of the page.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Currently revealed hints:</b>
				<br>
				(Dec 13) - "Most important to protect"
				<br>
				(Dec 14) - "i loooooooooooove"
				<br>
				
				<br>
				<i>Come back tomorrow for the next hint.</i>				
				<br><br><br>
				<span style="font-size:22px; margin-left:-14px"><i>A secret page seems to be broken?</i></span><br>
				<span style="margin-left:-12px">-</span> The secret pages have been tested using a Windows 10 machine running the Firefox web browser. There's no guarantee that they'll work properly on other browsers, or other machines.	
				
				<br><br><br>
				
				<span style="font-size:22px; margin-left:-14px"><i>Is this official?</i></span><br>
				<span style="margin-left:-12px"><u>Big-T Rex:</u></span><br>"No, I am not the creator of Draconia, so all content here is unofficial fan content, theories and headcanons of my interpretation of Draconia. Many of the pages here are relating to Draconia AUs (Alternate Universes) that do not take place in the main Draconia world. Some of the others do, but they contain theories and ideas for what I suspect will happen in future chapters, and they may be proven false as Draconia continues to finish more chapters."<br>"That being said, my sister works at Draconia and she told me that Spei is actually- OH SHOOT SHE'S AFTER ME GOTTA GO"

				<span style="margin-left:-12px"><u>Big-T Rex:</u></span><br>"Yes, and I'm related to Frutz."
