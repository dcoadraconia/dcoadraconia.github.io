				<br><br>
				"And? You actually think this is a good f***ing idea? Did you accident'ly get some of it in your f***ing head? You'll probably miss the royals, and end up starting an entire f***ing plague instead!"

				<br><br>

				<br><br>
				"We don't need the Capital! You're risking everything just to grab a bit more power? Look around you, Redwood! You've turned the Old Branch Commune into an unstoppable gang! Your men rob anyone who so much as TRIPS too close to the Commune! We've got more food and rich f******' valuables than we know what to do with! How is this not enough for you? How the f*** do you want MORE?"
				<br><br>

I won't be satisfied until the people finally hav' the chance to rise up, and ev'ry last one of those nobles faces the consequences for their greedy lives!"
				<br><br>

				<i>Redwood suddenly snarls, becoming visibly enraged.</i>

				"YOU HAVE NO F***ING IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, SAGE! I THINK ABOUT YOU ALL EVERY DAY! I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE I F***ING CARE!"
				<br><br>
				<i>Redwood picks up a large piece of wood from the floor and throws it across the room. It smashes into a barrel in the corner of the room with a loud crash, completely breaking the top of the barrel into pieces.</i>

				<i>Sage backs away toward the door. Redwood stands in the center of the room, panting.</i>

				<br><br>
				<i>Redwood opens his mouth to say something. But before he can, Sage turns and runs out of the room.</i>

				<br><br>
				<i>Redwood takes a few steps toward the door. He stands in front of it for a few seconds, staring blankly out the doorway, deep in thought... before closing it again with a heavy sigh.
