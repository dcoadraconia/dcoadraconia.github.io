		One year, no, one month ago everything seemed normal, despite that pretender writing our doom in the stars over a century ago. Our F̷̯̭͓̭̙̩̾̽͘l̸̞̄͌̇͆ư̸̧͇̤̤̱͛͆̄̕c̷̨̧͈͚̟̅̌̔͛͊͜͝t̶̢̺̏̋̀͘ų̷̩̀̈́s̴̯̟̻̃̇̿̆͜, the Ghost Seer, Saxum, our beloved Stella, the other lords and ladies all went about with their duties and recreation. After what the sun dragons did, the creator of creators gave them her first of many “gifts” in order to pacify them. They deserved every bit of what happened of course, and yet that great and brilliant hypocrite decided to continue in her “generosity.” She and F̶̮̰̤͕̬͝l̷̲͓͇͉̮̀͘u̶̡͈͇͖͇͌̒̑̊̚c̴͚̔̔̊̆͂t̶̺̣̜͓̲̄̆̀ư̵̖̿́̚͠s̵̲̺͕̿̀ being so obviously above us mortals, bestowed upon us more “gifts,” despite our pleading. After that it was only a matter of years before she bestowed her third and final gift on our poor Lady Stella, forcing her to lie to us and herself, forcing her to forget the one she loved. To think I once looked up to that high and mighty creator of creators and queen of lies.<br>

<div style="margin-left: -66px;">And to the Hypocrite herself, a little free form poem for your pleasure:</div>
I can’t believe I followed you onto this deathtrap. <br>
Thank you Spe.<br>
I can’t believe what our Lord F̸͍̝̓̄͠l̷̘̖̰̭̤̉̂̃ú̴͉̦͉̩̿̈́͗̀ċ̵̱͚͆̂̐̚͠t̷̤͗̚ự̴̮͇̟́̈́̐̀͆s̴̨̲̙̈̈́͑ did to Saxum’s face. <br>
Thank you Spe. <br>
I can’t believe I’ll be dead in within the hour.<br>
Thank you Spe.<br>
I can’t believe I heard Elara die through the rocks.<br>
Thank you Spe.<br>
I can’t believe you sacrificed all who you promised to keep safe. <br>
Thank you Spe and thank you again for making all these things to happen.<br>
Somehow, I still believe there is hope.<br>
So thank you for lying to me in that regard as well. <br>
I hope with all my dwindling breath you are paid back for your generosity.<br>
</div>
<br>
<p style="text-indent: 66px;">Here I am, trapped in this storage room full of ink and candles, pretending someone will one day read what I am writing all thanks to your gifts. I suppose while I wait on my own asphyxiation, I will also pretend I am back home in Crescent Bay. I will pretend I am telling spunky little Elara stories of the Lords and Ladies, I will pretend my loving Proteus is still by my side. I will pretend I still look up to and respect the Ghost Seer. I will pretend this small wax candle is my grandfather’s lighthouse, all while it burns the little air I have left in my grave.
