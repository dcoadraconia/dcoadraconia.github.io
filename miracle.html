It's heavily guarded, and on top of that it's locked, and the only ones who have the keys are the guards."<br>"I was <i>planning</i> for Siege to cut into the laboratory through one of the walls, but seeing as he isn't here, I suppose we're going to figure something else out."

				<tr><th>				
					79438:</th><td>"So, once we manage to get past the guards... I haven't been inside in a long time. They've probably had all sorts of renovations by now... Security improvements. I remember everything was already pretty... well-protected when I was here, and it looks like things have only gotten more complicated. The guards are only the first layer. That's why I was hoping we wouldn't just walk into the main entrance."
				</td></tr>

At the sound, two of the four laboratory guards moved away from the door to investigate, stomping over to look around the area where the metal had fell. The two other guards remained in place.]

					[Boosted by the magical effects of Agent 77355's Mystic Gale spell, Agent 79438 suddenly darted from behind one metal obstruction to another, in clear view of the remaining guards. One guard pointed at the space where Agent 79438 was a moment ago, demanding whoever he saw to identify themself. Both guards began to walk toward this location.]
				</td></tr>
				<tr><td colspan="2">				
					[As the guards passed by Agent 77355's hiding location, Agent 77355 cast a wind spell on the key held by one of the guards, lifting it up and off of the guard's key holder loop. The wind carried the key quickly and quietly backward to Agent 77355, and safely into his open claw.]
				</td></tr>
				<tr><td colspan="2">				
					[Meanwhile, Agent 79438 ducked into an alcove she had scouted out earlier, and slashed her saber through the open air, shooting out a cleaving gust of wind toward a nearby pile of scrap metal that the agents had stacked up for their plan. The wind projectile, created as a result of Agent 79438's Windcleaver technique, smashed into the metal pile, causing it all to fall over and produce a thunderous commotion of metal noises. This drew the attention of all four guards, who passed by Agent 79438's hidden presence as well, looking to investigate the noise.]
				</td></tr>
				<tr><td colspan="2">				
					[With all four guards distracted, Agent 77355 snuck over to the now-unguarded laboratory door, and inserted the key that he had stolen into the lock. As he unlocked the door, Agent 79438 used her remaining burst of Mystic Gale energy to quickly dash out from the alcove she was hiding in, and again out of view of the guards. Agent 79438 made her way to the now-unlocked lab door, regrouping with Agent 77355.]
				</td></tr>
				<tr><td colspan="2">				
					[Agent 77355 quietly opened the door, and both agents prepared to enter. At this time, though, a fifth guard suddenly appeared, walking into view from behind the side of the laboratory. This guard was on a patrol route around the perimeter of the laboratory, and was a complication that the agents had not foreseen.]

					[The guard prepared to raise the alarm, but before she was successful, Agent 77355 shot out a blast of wind from his staff, launching the alarm device out of the guard's claw and into the distance. The guard was momentarily stunned by this, and before she could finish processing it, Agent 79438 slashed out with her saber, cutting into the guard's voice mechanism and disabling her ability to speak or call the other guards over.]

					[Coming to her senses, the guard let out a grating metal growl and slammed her body into the two agents, knocking them to the ground. She slashed and struck at the agents with her claws, injuring them. After lashing out with her tail and sweeping them aside, she then turned and started moving as quickly as she could toward the other guards.]

				<tr><td colspan="2">				
					[Agents 79438 and 77355 struggled to their feet and tried to stop the guard. Agent 79438's sustained damage was only to her plating, so she quickly recovered, jumped up at the guard and started slashing at her. However, the guard was a Rammer model and thus had a lot of durability, so she wasn't able to slow her down.]
				</td></tr>
				<tr><td colspan="2">				
					[Meanwhile, Agent 77355's injuries were more serious, as he was not armored. He attempted to use a Dizzying Twister spell on the guard, but he was unsuccessful due to difficulty focusing because of the injury, and due to the mass of the guard. The guard pulled herself out of the cyclone and kept going.]
				</td></tr>

					[Before the guard could get far, though, she was interrupted as another Rammer model came flying through the air out of nowhere, crashing straight into her and rendering her unconscious. For a moment, Agents 79438 and 77355 were worried that this was another guard, but they quickly noticed the metal plates of armor covering the Rammer's body and arms. This Rammer was not a guard, but rather Agent 25625 “Siege”, the lead agent of team Ζ6.]

Agent 79438 beckoned for the two other agents to come in through the door. Agent 77355 immediately did so, and Agent 25625 followed after picking up the unconscious body of the guard and carrying it in with them, so the other guards wouldn't find it.]
